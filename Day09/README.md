# Day 9: Rope Bridge

Today was a good day. The solution was straightforward and I got some experience with `pair` and `set` in C++.
I did realize, however, that I'm really bad at carefully reading code.
I make a lot of mistakes when programming with things like ternary sequences, where I don't notice typos.
It makes me wonder if there's a variable color-coding utility out there.

I checked, but alas. It may be a fun exercise as the first extension I ever develop. But maybe in the new year.

I also updated the template so that I don't need to rename nearly as many files.
Now I should just have to edit the README and the directory name, rather than the Makefile, `Day xx.cpp`, README, and directory.
